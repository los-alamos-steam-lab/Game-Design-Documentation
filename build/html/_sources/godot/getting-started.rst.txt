Getting Started with Godot
=======================================


Introduction
------------

The Godot Game Engine is a free and open source engine that handles 
both 2D and 3D game design. Most of the coding tutorials will be centered around Godot.

Downloading
----------------

Godot works on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.  It can be downloaded from 
the development site (https://godotengine.org) or from Steam.  

Everything in this tutorial has been tested on Godot 3.2.  It should work 
fairly seamlessly until Godot 4 is released.

Setting up the Environment
-----------------------------

Comment Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Being able to easily comment and uncomment blocks of code is crucial
to programming and particularly debugging.  Most modern editors 
toggle comments with Ctrl-/ (Cmd-/).  

This can be set in Editor Settings (in the Editor Dropdown Menu) under
the Shorcuts Tab.  Search "Comment" to find the Toggle Comment shortcut.
Click on the pencil icon and then press your preferred key combination.
Click OK with your mouse when you are done.

Indenting
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Being able to indent and unindent blocks of code is also crucial
to programming, especially when moving around chunks of code.  
Most modern editors indent with Ctrl-] (Cmd-]) and unindent with 
Ctrl-[ (Cmd-[).

This can be set in Editor Settings (in the Editor Dropdown Menu) under
the Shorcuts Tab.  Search "Indent" to find the Indent Left and Indent Right 
shortcuts. Click on the pencil icon and then press your preferred key combination.
Click OK with your mouse when you are done.
