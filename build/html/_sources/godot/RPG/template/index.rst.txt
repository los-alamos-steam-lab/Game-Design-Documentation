Top Down RPG: Template
=======================================

This tutorial provides you with a fairly robust template for a top-down 
RPG.  It is based off of fornclake's Zelda-Like for Godot 3.1<https://github.com/fornclake/Zelda-like-3.1>
with additions from his tutorials as well as new features.

In the end it has a player, enemy, sword, configurable enemy item drops, keys and locked doors, 
teleport, individually loadable maps, and save games.

The source is available on github at: https://github.com/los-alamos-steam-lab/Game-Design-Template

and can be cloned with: git clone https://github.com/los-alamos-steam-lab/Game-Design-Template.git

In the next few chapters we'll cover how some of the mechanics work.
