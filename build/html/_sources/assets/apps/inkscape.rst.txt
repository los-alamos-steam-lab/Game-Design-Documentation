Inkscape
=======================================

Summary
----------

Inkscape is an open source vector graphics program.  It allows you 
to create scalable images.  You'll need to export them as bitmaps eventually, 
but this is a great starting point if you are unsure of your tilesize or 
want to easily change around shapes and colors
