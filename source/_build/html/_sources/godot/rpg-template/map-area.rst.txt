Creating your First Map Area
=======================================


Introduction
------------

Creating your own area is a good start to making the game your own. 
Even if it is a very simple test area, it will help get you started with
the rest of the game, as it will define the size of your tilesets.

Drawing the Scene

  (Project Settings -> General -> Display -> Window )
