Top Down RPG
=======================================

This tutorial relies heavily on a video series made by fornclake 
a couple of years ago. Along with his videos, Iâ€™ve provided the 
code (updated for Godot 3.1) and lot of comments. 
I recommend following along with the first few videos on your 
own in order to get used to the game engine, and then just 
copying my code as needed.

At the end I have a very small but pretty functional base game 
that has a sword, enemy, enemy drops, pickups, health, locked 
doors, save games, and teleporting. It would make a great 
template for almost any real time RPG.
